I am a Computer Science fresh graduate from **Nanyang Technological University** specialising in Data Science & Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. 

My area of interest lies in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I am deeply fascinated by the rapid advancements in A.I. and how widely they are integrated into our daily lives such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, facial and image recognition. I also like working with and mining large datasets. 

I read articles on [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science/home) I find interesting and fascinating. To me, learning is a lifelong process, and these articles are a source of inspiration that leads to my own personal development.

If you have any queries or anything to share, I am always available at my socials below, otherwise feel free to drop me an email at <angtw1994@gmail.com>!
