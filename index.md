Welcome to my website, I'm Kevin Ang, a Singapore-based computer science professional with 4 years of working experience.
 
I graduated from **Nanyang Technological University** specialising in **Data Science & Analytics** and **Artificial Intelligence**. With a background in computer science and expertise in these cutting-edge fields, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects that leverage technology to solve modern day complex problems. 

Personally, I am deeply fascinated by the rapid advancements in A.I. and how widely they are integrated into our daily lives such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, facial and image recognition. As a huge math buff, I also like working with and mining large datasets.

In my own free time, I like to explore the stock market (NYSE), research on technical analysis and lightly dabble in derivatives trading. Some of my other interests include gymming, driving and poker.

If you have any queries or anything to share, I am always available at my socials below, otherwise feel free to drop me an email at <angtw1994@gmail.com>!
