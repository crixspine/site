I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate at **Nanyang Technological University**. 

My area of interest lies in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I am deeply fascinated by the rapid advancements in A.I. and how widely they are integrated into our daily lives such as self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, face and image recognition. I also like working with large datasets.

I visit [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science/home) a lot; Many a times, they publish interesting articles which I find fascinating and thought-provoking. To me, learning is a lifelong process - these articles are a source of inspiration that leads to my own personal development by honing my skills as a Data Scientist.
